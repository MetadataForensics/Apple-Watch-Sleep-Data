# Apple Watch Sleep Data
Our SQL query for an "at a glance" review of sleep periods when the Apple Watch is worn, given required user settings. 

The Apple Watch Sleep app offers valuable insights into sleep patterns through its categorization of sleep stages and detailed tracking capabilities. Despite some challenges in data parsing from the healthdb_secure.sqlite database, the information stored within can be instrumental in forensic analysis. It is our hope these SQL queries aid in the accurate parsing and analysis of Sleep data.
